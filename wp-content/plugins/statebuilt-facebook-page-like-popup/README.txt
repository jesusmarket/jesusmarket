Promote your Facebook Fan Page with a sleek customizable slide-in popup. Supports 91 different languages.

== Description ==

With the Statebuilt Facebook Page Like Popup Plugin, you can promote your Facebook Page to encourage visitors to connect with you on Facebook. The timers and Facebook Page information are customizable.

### Encourage Visitors to Connect with you on Facebook
Your popup contains Like and Share buttons, encouraging your visitors to connect with you on Facebook. Visitors will also see the familiar faces of their friends who have also liked your Facebook Page.

### Multilingual Support!
Choose from 91 different languages to display in your popup!

### Responsive / Adaptive Width
As of version 1.0.2 the Statebuilt Facebook Page Like Popup will adapt on pageload to be larger on desktop view and smaller on mobile view, to ensure that it looks great no matter what devices your visitors are using!

### Won't Annoy Your Readers
As of version 1.0.0, your popup will slide in on the bottom left corner of the browser, so as not to annoy your readers. How many times have you been in the middle of an article only to be interrupted by an obstructive, clunky pop up? Statebuilt Facebook Page Like Popup will capture your readers' attention without completely obstructing your visitors' experience.

### Custom Settings
See a preview on your settings page of what your visitors will see on your website and set custom timers for your popup that will affect how quickly the popup appears after the pages loads and how long to wait in between the popup firing for the user.
